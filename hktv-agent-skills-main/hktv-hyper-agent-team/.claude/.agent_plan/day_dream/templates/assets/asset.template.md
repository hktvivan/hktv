## 🖼️ The Artifact

<!--
The actual visual/non-code content goes here.
Use appropriate format based on Type:

- mockup: ASCII art, Mermaid, or link to external tool
- diagram: Mermaid preferred, ASCII acceptable
- storyboard: Numbered sequence with descriptions
- infrastructure: System topology, deployment diagram
- design: UI flow, component layout
- data-model: ERD, schema, data dictionary
- other: Whatever fits

For external assets (Figma, Excalidraw, etc.):
1. Include a low-fi representation here (ASCII/Mermaid)
2. Link to the source file
-->

```mermaid
{Diagram content OR placeholder}
```

**Source File:** {Link to Figma/Excalidraw/etc., or "Embedded above"}

ASSET DOCUMENT NOTES:

NAMING CONVENTION: {feature_id}_{description}.asset.md
  Examples: 03_dashboard_mockup.asset.md
            05_data_flow_diagram.asset.md
            login_storyboard.asset.md (standalone, no feature ID)

WHEN TO CREATE:
- Visual design that needs stakeholder approval
- Architecture/flow diagrams that inform implementation
- UI mockups before coding
- Infrastructure topology for deployment planning
- Any non-code artifact that blocks or informs development

TYPE GUIDE:
| Type | Content | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| mockup | UI wireframes, screen layouts | ASCII, Mermaid, Excalidraw, Figma |
| diagram | System architecture, flows | Mermaid, draw.io |
| storyboard | User journey sequences | Numbered steps with visuals |
| infrastructure | Deployment, networking | Mermaid, ASCII topology |
| design | Visual design, branding | Figma, external links |
| data-model | ERD, schemas | Mermaid ERD, ASCII tables |
| other | Anything else | As appropriate |

LINE LIMIT: ~100 lines (excluding embedded diagrams)
This is a SUPPORTING artifact, not primary documentation.

LIFECYCLE:
1. Created in Draft by HyperDream
2. Reviewed and iterated
3. Approved by stakeholder/implementing agent
4. Frozen when implementation begins
5. New version created if changes needed post-freeze

EXTERNAL ASSETS:
Always include a low-fidelity representation in the doc itself.
External tools can disappear; the doc should be self-sufficient.
