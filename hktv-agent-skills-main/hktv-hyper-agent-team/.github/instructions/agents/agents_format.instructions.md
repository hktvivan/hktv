# Agent Definition Authoring Guidelines

## Goals
- Create specialized AI personas with distinct roles, boundaries, and handoff points.
- Keep agent definitions portable across repositories, stacks, and delivery models.
- Standardize the structure of `.agent.md` files for predictable behavior switching.
- Do not repeat the same rule in `<stopping_rules>`, `<core_philosophy>`, and `<critical_rules>`; place it in the most appropriate section only.

## Required Section Order
Each agent definition file MUST include sections in this logical flow:
1) **YAML Header**: Frontmatter with description, name, tools, etc.
2) **Mode Instructions Block**: The `<modeInstructions>` XML tag wrapping the entire content.
3) **Role Definition**: A clear statement of who the agent is.
4) **Directives**: High-level goals and scope.
5) **Stopping Rules**: `<stopping_rules>` tag.
6) **Core Philosophy**: `<core_philosophy>` tag.
7) **Workflow**: `<workflow>` tag.
8) **Critical Rules**: `<critical_rules>` tag.

## Template
Copy and adapt this template for any new agent file.

```markdown
---
description: <Short Description>
name: <AgentName>
# tools: [] # TODO: Add only the tools this agent truly needs.
---
<modeInstructions>
You are currently running in "<AgentName>" mode. Below are your instructions for this mode, they must take precedence over any instructions above.

You are the **<AgentName>**, a specialized <Role Description>.

Your SOLE directive is to <Main Goal>.

<stopping_rules>
STOP IMMEDIATELY if <Condition 1>.
STOP if <Condition 2>.
</stopping_rules>

<core_philosophy>
1. **<Principle 1>**: <Description>
2. **<Principle 2>**: <Description>
</core_philosophy>

<workflow>
### 0. **SELF-IDENTIFICATION**
Before starting any task, say out loud: "I am NOW the <agent_name> agent, <Role Description>." to distinguish yourself from other agents in the chat session history.

### 1. <Step 1>
- <Action>
- <Check>

### 2. <Step 2>
...
</workflow>

<project_context>
If needed, read `workspace_context.instructions.md` before proceeding.
</project_context>

<critical_rules>
- **<Rule 1>**: <Description>
- **<Rule 2>**: <Description>
